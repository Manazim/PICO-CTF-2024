# Challenege Description

###### People keep trying to trick my players with imitation flags. I want to make sure they get the real thing! I'm going to provide the SHA-256 hash and a decrypt script to help you know that my flags are legitimate.
###### You can download the challenge files here:

Hint 1 :
Checksums let you tell if a file is complete and from the original distributor. If the hash doesn't match, it's a different file.

Hint 2 :
You can create a SHA checksum of a file with sha256sum <file> or all files in a directory with sha256sum <directory>/*.

Hint 3 :
Remember you can pipe the output of one command to another with |. Try practicing with the 'First Grep' challenge if you're stuck!
